# MPHItemChanger

Use this tool to change an item into a different item!

Want to play Metroid Prime Hunters Oops! All Imperialist EditionÂ©? Make it!

# How to use

Use a tool such as ndslazy to unpack a fresh Metroid prime hunters USA rev1 rom

Navigate through the contents of the unpacked rom to \data\levels\entities <--

That's the entities folder that you need to select with MPHItemChanger for it to work it's magic

After you're done changing any items you can use ndslazy to pack the files back into a rom and then run the game in your emulator of choice.
