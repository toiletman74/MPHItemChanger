# MPHItemChanger

Use this tool to change an item into a different item!

Want to play Metroid Prime Hunters Oops! All Imperialist EditionÂ©? Make it!

# How to use

Use a tool such as ndslazy to unpack a fresh Metroid prime hunters USA rev1 rom

Navigate through the contents of the unpacked rom to \data\levels\entities <--

That's the entities folder that you need to select with MPHItemChanger for it to work it's magic

After you're done changing any items you can use ndslazy to pack the files back into a rom and then run the game in your emulator of choice.

# Special Thanks

to unknown and NoneGiven for writing **[MPHread](https://github.com/NoneGiven/MphRead)** (I read through their code to figure out how to change entities into different ones)

# Notice
I made a pre built release for downloading otherwise you can build it yourself if you want.

also yes I do know it says MPHrando, thats what this project is gonna turn into so I didn't bother changing the name.

and I won't be writing code to unpack and repack the rom with just this tool at this time since I'm probably not gonna work on this tool again.
